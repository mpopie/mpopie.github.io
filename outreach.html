I subscribe to <a href="https://fardila.com/"> Frederico Ardila's</a> axioms for education and outreach:
   <br>
  <br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Axiom 1 </td>
    <td>Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td> Axiom 2 </td>
    <td>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Axiom 3 </td>
    <td>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Axiom 4 </td>
    <td>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  In 2025 - 2026, I am co-organizing the Northwestern topology seminar with Ben Antieau and Noah Riggenbach.
  <br><br>
I am organizing the <a href="https://icms.ac.uk/activities/workshop/younghomotopytheorists/" > Young Homotopy-Theorist Meeting</a> at the ICMS in Edinburgh, October 6-10 2025. In addition to successfully applying for the ICMS to host the event, we have secured funding from the Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust, Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, London Mathematicalcal Society, and National Science Foundation (travel for USA-based participants).
  
<br> <br> 
For three summers (2022 - 2024), I was a mentor and instructor for the CSU-UCLA Summer Bridge Program at UCLA. As part of this program, I designed one-week mini courses for students from Cal State University Campuses to learn about advanced math topics in an interactive, small-group setting. I also provided support and mentorship for students interested in pursuing PhDs in mathematics.
  <br> <br> 

For three years (Spring 2021 - 2024) I was an organizer for the UCLA algebraic topology seminar. 
  <br> <br> 

For four years (2018 - 2022), I was an organizer for the  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/talbotworkshop3">MIT Talbot Workshop</a>. I am still happy to talk about Talbot, but queries related to upcoming Talbots should be directed to the current organizers.
